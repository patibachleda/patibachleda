## Patrycja Bachleda
#### Software Engineering Student

###### Hi! My name is Patrycja or Pati for short ðŸ˜„ I am currently trying to build up my resume with projects that will help me transition from a student to a software engineer.
###### I am interested in web, app, and game development so my projects will reflect knowledge of new programs, languages, or computer concepts.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Path finding React application
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: React JS
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can finally do a pull up!
